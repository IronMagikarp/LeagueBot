# The Anti-League Discord Bot 

## What does it do?
This simple python discord bot will inform any current league player that they are playing too much league (games lasting 30+ minutes) for their own good by pinging them to stop.

## How?
The bot when prompted by the user scour the user list of the server it was prompted from and search for any activity that contains the phrase "league of legends" if so, the bot will then calculate the time difference from when they opened league till 'now'.
