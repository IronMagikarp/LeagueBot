# The Anti-League Discord Bot 

## What does it do?
This simple python discord bot is based off the meme which was that someone made a discord bot which bans people if they've been playing league for more than 30 minutes. I just made a version of that without the banning for fun ðŸ˜ƒ

## How?
The bot when prompted by the user scour the user list of the server it was prompted from and search for any activity that contains the phrase "league of legends" if so, the bot will then calculate the time difference from when they opened league till 'now'.
